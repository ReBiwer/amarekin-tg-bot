## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Houses the FastAPI application.
  - `backend/app/api/`: FastAPI routes.
  - `backend/app/core/`: Application configuration, settings, and exceptions.
  - `backend/app/db/`: Database related logic using SQLAlchemy.
  - `backend/app/models/`: Pydantic models and SQLAlchemy models.
  - `backend/app/services/`: Business logic and Langchain integration.
  - `backend/app/schemas/`: Pydantic schemas for data validation.
  - `backend/app/utils/`: Utility functions, e.g., PyJWT.
- `migrations/`: Alembic migrations for database schema management.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.

## Setup

1.  **Install `uv`**: If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it via `pipx`:
    ```bash
    pipx install uv
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project root and run:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Note: `requirements.txt` will be generated by `uv` or manually created initially)
3.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example` (will be provided later).

## Running the Application

Detailed instructions for running the bot and backend will be provided here.
